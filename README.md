## About
This project explores public opinions on affirmative action, abortion, and capital punishment through exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

## Data
Using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), we investigate how different groupsâ€™ opinions have shifted over time and explore any correlations between these views and the demographic factors. This analysis will provide a clearer picture of the broader trends in public opinion and the factors that influence these complex issues.
