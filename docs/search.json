    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we explore opinions on affirmative action, abortion, and capital punishment between social groups (e.g. gender, age, race) with the goal of identifying where there are the biggest disparities and how those disparities have changed over the past 50 years.\nSpecifically, we seek to answer the following questions: 1. Which groups of people (e.g. gender, age, race) agree the most on abortion, affirmative action, and capital punishment? Which differ the most? What are possible explanations for this? 2. Have peoples’ opinions on these issues changed over the past 50 years? How so?\nUnderstanding how people’s views on these issues have evolved over time — and how they vary across different demographic groups such as gender, age, political affiliation, and other factors — can offer valuable insights into societal changes and help explain current political and social divisions. The demographic variables of interest in this analysis include gender, age, geographic location, political affiliation, race, year, education level, income, religious affiliation, and marital status/relationship. By using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), we will investigate how different groups’ opinions have shifted over time and explore any correlations between these views and the demographic factors. This analysis will provide a clearer picture of the broader trends in public opinion and the factors that influence these morally complex issues.\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is a nationally representative survey of US adults run by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, with surveys that ran every one to two years dating back to 1972 on a wide range of topics, with at least 1,500 respondents in every sample."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data will be retrieved from the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of US adults run by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, with surveys that ran every one to two years dating back to 1972 on a wide range of topics, with at least 1,500 respondents in every sample. The data can be downloaded with the use of their API and the packages gssr and gssrdoc, and contains demographic information on respondents. The major flaw in this data source is that it is almost entirely self-reported survey data. Although this is inevitable when working with survey and social data, it is particularly notable that almost all of the GSS data is the result of self-reported. Furthermore, while at the start the survey ran every year, after 1994, the GSS switched to running on every even-numbered year. This presented significant problems during the COVID pandemic beginning in 2020. Any time series analysis will have to take into account these uneven time points.",

Not all questions were asked in all years of the survey. The main pattern here is that our response variables (abany = “Whether it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion if the woman wants it for any reason”; discaff = “What do you think the chances are these days that a white person won’t get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified black person gets one instead?”; cappun = “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?”) are much more likely to be missing. This is because not every question was asked every year of the survey, and respondents are more likely to refuse to answer controversial questions than demographic data such as region, age, etc.\n\n\n2.2.2 Capital Punishment (cappun) missing row analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncp &lt;- gss_all |&gt; filter(cappun==1 | cappun==2)\n\ncp_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  column = names(colSums(is.na(cp))),\n  missing_count = sort(colSums(is.na(cp))),\n  total_responses = nrow(cp)\n)\n\n# variables of interest\ncp_df_2 &lt;- cp_df |&gt; filter(column %in% c('age', 'race', 'sex', 'region', 'relig', 'degree'))\n\n# percentage of missing data\ncp_df$missing_percentage &lt;- (cp_df$missing_count / cp_df$total_responses) * 100\ncp_df_2$missing_percentage &lt;- (cp_df_2$missing_count / cp_df_2$total_responses) * 100\n\ncp_df_sorted &lt;- cp_df |&gt; arrange(missing_percentage)\n\ncp_df_2_sorted &lt;- cp_df_2 |&gt; \n  arrange(missing_percentage) |&gt; \n  mutate(column = factor(column, levels = column))\n\ntop_50_present &lt;- cp_df_sorted |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 50) |&gt; \n  mutate(column = factor(column, levels = column))\n\nggplot(top_50_present, aes(x = column, y = missing_percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Top 50 Most Present Columns',\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Missing Rows (%)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", missing_percentage)), \n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    size = 2.5\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cp_df_2_sorted, aes(x = column, y = missing_percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Variables of Interest %Missing',\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Missing Rows (%)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", missing_percentage)), \n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    size = 2.5\n  )",

|&gt; filter(!(year %in% c(1977:2022) & is.na(`any reason`)))\n\n\nBefore we start data analysis, we first load the data and the variables we are interested in. The data can be easily accessed through the gssr package We select specific abortion-related variables as well as demographic variables. We choose seven abortion variables each representing a different reason a woman could be seeking an abortion and respondents’ opinion (Yes, No, NA) on whether a woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion for such a reason. The demographic variables selected are the following:\n\nsex\nage\nrace\ndegree: highest degree achieved\nmarital: marital status\nchilds: total number of children\nrelig16: religion raised in\nrelig: current religious preference\npartyid: political party affiliation\npolviews: political/social views (think of self as liberal or conservative)\nreg16: Region of residence at age 16\nreg: region of interview\n\nWe clean and transform the data by mutating categorical variables into factors with meaningful labels. We also remove the rows with NA values in the abortion-related columns. This is because we discovered through data exploration that the NA values pertaining to these variables represent inapplicable responses. Therefore, we remove these rows to ensure that we only use relevant and complete data for further analysis.\n\n\n3.1.2 Does the public opinion on abortion vary based on the reason a woman is seeking abortion ?\n\n\nCode\n# Transforming the data into long format\ngss_abortion_reason_long_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      select(c(year, abortion_reason, response)) |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\",\"rape\",\"birth defect\",\"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\")))\n\n# Stacked bar chart to show the responses of respondents on whether a woman should be able to legally obtain an abortion based on the reason for seeking abortion\nggplot(gss_abortion_reason_long_noNA |&gt; filter(!is.na(response)), aes(x=abortion_reason, fill= response))+\n  geom_bar(position=\"fill\") + \n  labs(title = \"Public Opinions on Whether a Pregnant Woman Should Be Allowed to Obtain a Legal Abortion \\n Categorized by Reason\", y = \"Percentage of Respondents\", x = \"Reason for Abortion\", fill = \"Response\") + theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first seek to investigate whether the general public opinion on abortion varies based on the reason a woman seeks abortion. We include data from the entire period of 50 years (1977-2022). Note that the seven variables we choose represent the following reasons:\n\nmother's health: If the woman’s own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy?\nrape: If she became pregnant as a result of rape?\nbirth defect: If there is a strong chance of serious defect in the baby?\nfinancial hardship: If the family has a very low income and cannot afford any more children?\nmarried-no more children: If she is married and does not want any more children?\nnot married: If she is not married and does not want to marry the man?\nany reason: If the woman wants it for any reason?\n\nThese variables are originally labeled abhlth, abrape, abdefect, abpoor, abnomore, absingle, and abany respectively. All these variables were included in the GSS survey from 1972 to 2022, except for the “abany” (abortion for any reason) variable which was only included starting in 1977.\nThe category receiving the most support for abortion is when the mother’s health is at risk, as 89.3% of respondents are in favor of abortion in this case. Abortion in cases of rape or a potential serious defect in the baby also receives strong supoort at 81.54% and 80.02% respectively. Support for the remaining reasons is much lower. Only 50% of respondents vote in favor of abortion when the reason is financial hardship. Other reasons, such as when the mother is married but does not want more children, is unmarried and does not want to marry the father, or when abortion is sought for any reason, receive even less support. The graph reveals that the percentage of support is nearly identical for these reasons. This is an expected result, as these reasons are often viewed as less “detrimental” compared to situations where the health of the mother or baby is compromised. Seeking abortion for any reason is the category that receives the least amount of support of all the reasons the survey explores with only 45.12% of support.\n\n\n3.1.3 Does the public opinion on abortion vary across time? How does it vary for each of the reasons for seeking abortion?\n\n\nCode\ngss_abortion_noNA = gss_abortion_reason_long_noNA |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\n\nggplot(gss_abortion_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\" ), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason, na.rm=TRUE)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Percentage of Respondents In Favor of Abortion Categorized \\n  by Reason across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous() + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nSince public opinion on abortion in the United States varies depending on the reason for seeking an abortion, as shown by data collected between 1977 and 2022, a natural follow-up question is whether these opinions have changed over time. To explore this, we examine shifts in public opinion for each reason for seeking abortion. Several interesting trends emerge. First, abortion when the mother’s health is at risk has consistently received overwhelming support since 1972, maintaining around 80% support throughout this period. This is the only category that shows no significant changes in support over time. For all other reasons, however, support has fluctuated: a decline in support occurred between 1985 and 1987, followed by an increase between 1990 and 1995, a decline between 1995 and 2005, a noticeable increase in 2010, and then a steady rise thereafter.\nAs seen in the previous graph, the trend holds true, with overwhelming support for abortion when the mother’s health is at risk, followed by strong support for abortion in cases of rape and serious birth defects. The remaining reasons receive much lower levels of support, in the following order: financial hardship, the mother is married and does not want more children, the mother is single and does not want to marry the father, and finally, the lowest support is for abortion for any reason.\nAdditionally, we observe that support for abortion for any reason is consistently lower than support for other reasons until 1995, when it occasionally surpasses support for other categories in certain years.\nNotice that some of the trends observed in our data correspond to historical events in the U.S. that might have affected the public opinion on the question of abortion. For example, 1973 marks the year when the Roe v Wade decision was made by the US Supreme Court, legalizing abortion in the United States. As such, earlier support for abortion in the early 70s might have been fueled by this landmark decision. The rise of the religious right in the early 1980s as well as the passing of restrictive laws such as the Abortion Control Act of 1982 might have caused a decline in the public’s support of abortion. The early 1990s marked a surge of violence against clinics and providers as well as the The Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992, which protected Roe but allowed for state restrictions against abortion. Following 2010, activism relating to reproductive rights increased with movements like “#Me Too” and the passing of more restrictive laws in states such as Texas and North Dakota. Under Trump’s presidency, the anti-abortion movement continued to rise with more states attempting to pass more restrictive laws, however, this movement was faced by a rising push back although eventually the Dobbs case ultimately overturning Roe v Wade in 2022. Source\n\n\n3.1.4 How does the public opinion on abortion vary for different demographic groups across time? How does it vary for each of the reasons for seeking abortion? Which demographic show the most similarities amongst its groups and which shows the most differences?\nIn this report, we focus on presenting graphs that highlight the most significant similarities and differences in responses regarding the legality of abortion across demographics. While we explored all the demographic categories outlined in the Data Cleaning section, we found that some groups in particular exhibited notable differences in opinion. However, upon further investigation, we found out that the results for some demographics might be misleading due to the small representation of certain groups in the survey. For example, when examining religious affiliations of respondents, we found that 82.68% of respondents identified as Christian, while only 2.08% were Jewish, 0.19% Muslim, and 0.15% Hindu. Between 1977 and 2022, only 15 Native Americans and 63 Hindus were surveyed. As such, we are unable to make meaningful comparisons within these religious groups as the sample size of certain groups in the survey is very small and therefore analysis of any trends can be misleading. A similar issue arose when analyzing responses based on the highest degree achieved and race. For example, we found that 81.16% of respondents are white, which means that the sample of respondents lacks in racial diversity. Additionally, note that the racial categories considered in the survey were limited to “White,” “Black,” and “Other,” which further constrains the analysis.\nWith this being said, we found that different groups within the age and sex demographics do show similar trends across time in their support of abortion based on the different abortion reasons. These groups are also equally represented in the survey, which makes the analysis valid. Note that for the age demographic, each 5 year group represents 8-11% of the respondents, therefore the different age groups are equally represented. Then, for the sex demographic, around 44% are male and 55% are female. We present below the graph showing the percentage of each sex group in favor of abortion by abortion reason across time - the groups in this demographic show the most similarity in their trend of abortion support.\n\n\nCode\nprc_dem_sex_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\", \"rape\",\"birth defect\", \"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\"))) |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, sex, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\nggplot(prc_dem_sex_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\", sex != is.na(sex)), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Change in Percentage of Repondents In Favor of Abortion by Demographic (Sex) Group Across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(19) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous() +\n  facet_wrap(~sex, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the two groups show similar patterns of abortion support over time across different reasons, which is somewhat unexpected, as one might assume that women, given that abortion directly affects them more than men, would show stronger support. However, between 2010 and 2015, men appear to show more support for abortion in cases where the pregnancy results from rape compared to women. Support for abortion when the mother’s health is at risk also seems to be slightly higher among men. Additionally, the “married but does not want more children” category shows slightly more support from men than women between 2005 and 2015.\nThe demographic category that shows the most divergent trends is the one based on political and social views. The results here are not surprising, as we observe a clear upward trend in abortion support over time among the most liberal respondents, with high support for all abortion reasons. In contrast, conservatives show a downward trend in support over time, with much lower support for abortion except in cases of rape, the mother’s health, or fetal abnormalities. Moderates and those who identify as slightly conservative show relatively little variation in their views on abortion across time. Although each group in this demographic is well represented in the survey, only 3% of respondents identify as extremely liberal and 3% as extremely conservative (approximately 1,220 individuals in each group). We believe this low percentage reflects societal variation, and the sample size is sufficiently robust for analysis.\n\n\nCode\nprc_dem_polviews_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\", \"rape\",\"birth defect\", \"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\"))) |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, polviews, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\nggplot(prc_dem_polviews_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\"), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Change in Percentage of Repondents In Favor of Abortion by Demographic (Social/Political Belief) Group Across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(19) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous() +\n  facet_wrap(~polviews, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Tracking the change of one age group (Respondents born around 1952)\nWILL LIKELY REMOVE THIS SECTION\n(Tracking the change in opinion across time for different age groups is an interesting case to look at. This is because while age-related changes and societal shifts can be discerned in a graph comparing age groups across time, this approach can also be misleading as it might be overlooking generational differences. Therefore, we would like to investigate the change in opinion across time for one generation and explore whether the opinion of one generation show similar trends to the general population’s opinion across time. The results here are intriguing.\nWe follow the group of respondents who were in their 20s around 1972 across time and compare the graph showing their change in opinion with the general population’s. We first find that)\n\n\nCode\n#Transforming the data to make the age variable categorical\ngss_age_one_group_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      select(c(year, abortion_reason, response, age)) |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\", \"rape\",\"birth defect\", \"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\"))) |&gt;\n      mutate(age = case_when(age &lt; 20 ~ \"16-19\",\n                             age&gt;=20 & age &lt; 25 ~ \"20-24\",\n                             age&gt;=25 & age &lt; 30 ~ \"25-29\",\n                             age&gt;=30 & age &lt; 35 ~ \"30-34\",\n                             age&gt;=35 & age &lt; 40 ~ \"35-39\",\n                             age&gt;=40 & age &lt; 45 ~ \"40-44\",\n                             age&gt;=45 & age &lt; 50 ~ \"45-49\",\n                             age&gt;=50 & age &lt; 55 ~ \"50-54\",\n                             age&gt;=55 & age &lt; 60 ~ \"55-59\",\n                             age&gt;=60 & age &lt; 65 ~ \"60-64\",\n                             age&gt;=65 & age &lt;= 70 ~ \"65-70\",\n                             age&gt;70 ~ \"70+\"))\n\n#Only keeping the data for the group of respondents who were 20 around 1972\ngss_age_one_group_y_noNA = gss_age_one_group_noNA |&gt; \n                  filter(\n                          (year &gt;= 1972 & year &lt; 1977 & age == \"20-24\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 1977 & year &lt; 1982 & age == \"25-29\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 1982 & year &lt; 1987 & age == \"30-34\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 1987 & year &lt; 1992 & age == \"35-39\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 1992 & year &lt; 1997 & age == \"40-44\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 1997 & year &lt; 2002 & age == \"45-49\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 2002 & year &lt; 2007 & age == \"50-54\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 2007 & year &lt; 2012 & age == \"55-59\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 2012 & year &lt; 2017 & age == \"60-64\") |\n                          (year &gt;= 2017 & year &lt;= 2022 & age == \"65-70\")\n                        )\n\n# Transforming the data to access proportions by year, abortion reason and response for this group\ngss_age_group_years_noNA = gss_age_one_group_y_noNA |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, response) |&gt; summarize(n =n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\n\n#Graph showing the trend for the group born around 1952 across time\nage_group_noNA = ggplot(gss_age_group_years_noNA|&gt; filter(response == \"yes\"), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Following the Change in Opinion in Favor of Abortion for One Particular Group \\n (people born around 1952) Accross Time\") + theme_bw(12) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.35, 1)) \n\n#Graph showing the trend for the entire population across time\nentire_pop_noNA = ggplot(gss_abortion_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\" ), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason, na.rm=TRUE)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"   \", title = \"Following the Change in Opinion in Favor of Abortion for the Entire Survey Sample Across Time \\n \", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(12) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.35, 1))\n\n#ggpubr::ggarrange(age_group_noNA,entire_pop_noNA, widths = c(1.7,2))"
