    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn this project, we explore opinions on affirmative action, abortion, and capital punishment between social groups (e.g. gender, age, race) with the goal of identifying where there are the biggest disparities and how those disparities have changed over the past 50 years.\nSpecifically, we seek to answer the following questions: 1. Which groups of people (e.g. gender, age, race) agree the most on abortion, affirmative action, and capital punishment? Which differ the most? What are possible explanations for this? 2. Have peoples’ opinions on these issues changed over the past 50 years? How so?\nUnderstanding how people’s views on these issues have evolved over time — and how they vary across different demographic groups such as gender, age, political affiliation, and other factors — can offer valuable insights into societal changes and help explain current political and social divisions. The demographic variables of interest in this analysis include gender, age, geographic location, political affiliation, race, year, education level, income, religious affiliation, and marital status/relationship. By using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), we will investigate how different groups’ opinions have shifted over time and explore any correlations between these views and the demographic factors. This analysis will provide a clearer picture of the broader trends in public opinion and the factors that influence these morally complex issues.\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is a nationally representative survey of US adults run by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, with surveys that ran every one to two years dating back to 1972 on a wide range of topics, with at least 1,500 respondents in every sample.",

With regards to abortion, we choose seven abortion variables each representing a different reason a woman could be seeking an abortion and respondents’ opinion (Yes, No, NA) on whether a woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion for such a reason.\nFor affirmative action, we look at two opinion survey variables, discaff (which asks whether the respondent believes that white people are harmed by affirmative action), and affrmact (which asks about the respondents general support for affirmative action in the workplace).\nFor capital punishment, we look at cappun, which asks the respondents opinion on whether the death penalty should be a punishment for a murder conviction.\nWe clean and transform the data by mutating categorical variables into factors with meaningful labels. We also remove the rows with NA values in the abortion-related columns. This is because we discovered through data exploration that the NA values pertaining to these variables represent inapplicable responses. Therefore, we remove these rows to ensure that we only use relevant and complete data for further analysis. Similarly, inapplicable responses for capital punishment and affirmative action questions were discarded, as well as NA values for the demographic indicators we are investigating."

Not all questions were asked in all years of the survey. The main pattern here is that our response variables (abany = “Whether it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion if the woman wants it for any reason”; discaff = “What do you think the chances are these days that a white person won’t get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified black person gets one instead?”; cappun = “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?”) are much more likely to be missing. This is because not every question was asked every year of the survey, and respondents are more likely to refuse to answer controversial questions than demographic data such as region, age, etc.\n\n\n2.3.2 Abortion: Missing Variables\nIn our analysis of public opinion on abortion using the GSS data, we initially noticed a significant increase in the proportion of missing (NA) responses on abortion-related variables in some years, which led to suspicious decreases in the percentage of respondents in favor of abortion. Upon further investigation, we found that the missing responses were predominantly categorized as “NA(i)” (inapplicable), with only a small percentage of “NA(d)” (don’t know) responses, which would be expected in a survey of this nature. This is the result of the survey-ballot method behind the GSS, where not all questions are asked to all survey participants. Additionally, we decided to remove the other NA values at this time, as the other responses made up a very small proportion of answers. This decision was crucial, as including these NAs distorted the true proportions of “yes” and “no” responses, leading to potentially misleading conclusions about trends in abortion attitudes over time.\nBelow is a graph showing the percentage of missing values in each of the abortion-related variables we investigate in our analysis. Note that all the variables have a high percentage of missing values around 45% for “abortion for any reason” and around 35% for all other variables, as not all variables were included on all slates. Additionally, note that most of the missing values are inapplicable responses with over 90% of all missing values being inapplicable responses.\n\n\nCode\ngss_ab = gss_all |&gt;\n  select(c(year, abdefect, abnomore, abhlth, abpoor, abrape, absingle, abany, sex, age, race, degree, relig, relig16, marital, partyid, polviews, childs, region, reg16))\n\nabdefect = data.frame(base::table(haven::as_factor(gss_ab$abdefect, levels = \"labels\"))) |&gt;

We will therefore discard the inapplicable answers (iap), as they did not participate in these questions; and the “don’t know” values make up a small enough proportion of responses to be irrelevant to analyses.\n\n\n2.3.4 Capital Punishment (cappun) missing row analysis\nThe missing data analysis reveals that there are significant gaps in the information collected for this survey. The variable with the highest rate of missing values is religion, with 60.14% of responses lacking this data point. Region also has a high rate of missingness at 33.41%. Other variables with substantial missing information include degree (22.92% missing), sex (27.67% missing), and race (27.80% missing). The variable with the lowest rate of missing data is age, but even here 18.91% of responses are incomplete. These high levels of missingness across multiple key demographic variables could introduce bias and limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis. It will be important to carefully consider how to address these gaps, whether through imputation techniques or by restricting the analysis to only complete cases, in order to obtain reliable insights from the Capital Punishment dataset.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncp &lt;- gss_all |&gt; filter(cappun==1 | cappun==2)\n\ncp_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  column = names(colSums(is.na(cp))),\n  missing_count = sort(colSums(is.na(cp))),\n  total_responses = nrow(cp)\n)\n\n# variables of interest\ncp_df_2 &lt;- cp_df |&gt; filter(column %in% c('age', 'race', 'sex', 'region', 'relig', 'degree'))\n\n# percentage of missing data\ncp_df$missing_percentage &lt;- (cp_df$missing_count / cp_df$total_responses) * 100\ncp_df_2$missing_percentage &lt;- (cp_df_2$missing_count / cp_df_2$total_responses) * 100\n\ncp_df_sorted &lt;- cp_df |&gt; arrange(missing_percentage)\n\ncp_df_2_sorted &lt;- cp_df_2 |&gt; \n  arrange(missing_percentage) |&gt; \n  mutate(column = factor(column, levels = column))\n\ntop_50_present &lt;- cp_df_sorted |&gt; \n  slice_head(n = 50) |&gt; \n  mutate(column = factor(column, levels = column))\n\nggplot(top_50_present, aes(x = column, y = missing_percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Top 50 Most Present Columns',\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Missing Rows (%)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", missing_percentage)), \n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    size = 2.5\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cp_df_2_sorted, aes(x = column, y = missing_percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"darkgrey\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Variables of Interest %Missing',\n    x = \"Columns\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Missing Rows (%)\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", missing_percentage)), \n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    size = 2.5\n  ) + theme_bw()"

We include data from the entire period of 50 years (1977-2022). Note that the seven variables we choose represent the following reasons:\n\nmother's health: If the woman’s own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy?\nrape: If she became pregnant as a result of rape?\nbirth defect: If there is a strong chance of serious defect in the baby?\nfinancial hardship: If the family has a very low income and cannot afford any more children?\nmarried-no more children: If she is married and does not want any more children?\nnot married: If she is not married and does not want to marry the man?\nany reason: If the woman wants it for any reason?\n\nThese variables are originally labeled abhlth, abrape, abdefect, abpoor, abnomore, absingle, and abany respectively. All these variables were included in the GSS survey from 1972 to 2022, except for the “abany” (abortion for any reason) variable which was only included starting in 1977.\nThe category receiving the most support for abortion is when the mother’s health is at risk, as 89.3% of respondents are in favor of abortion in this case. Abortion in cases of rape or a potential serious defect in the baby also receives strong supoort at 81.54% and 80.02% respectively. Support for the remaining reasons is much lower. Only 50% of respondents vote in favor of abortion when the reason is financial hardship. Other reasons, such as when the mother is married but does not want more children, is unmarried and does not want to marry the father, or when abortion is sought for any reason, receive even less support. The graph reveals that the percentage of support is nearly identical for these reasons. This is an expected result, as these reasons are often viewed as less “detrimental” compared to situations where the health of the mother or baby is compromised. Seeking abortion for any reason is the category that receives the least amount of support of all the reasons the survey explores with only 45.12% of support.\n\n\n3.1.2 Does the public opinion on abortion vary across time? How does it vary for each of the reasons for seeking abortion?\n\n\nCode\ngss_abortion_noNA = gss_abortion_reason_long_noNA |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\n\nggplot(gss_abortion_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\" ), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason, na.rm=TRUE)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Percentage of Respondents In Favor of Abortion Categorized by Reason across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(12) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous()  + \n  #scale_color_brewer(name = \"Abortion Reason\", palette = \"Dark2\")  +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14)) \n\n\n\n\n\nSince public opinion on abortion in the United States varies depending on the reason for seeking an abortion, as shown by data collected between 1977 and 2022, a natural follow-up question is whether these opinions have changed over time. To explore this, we examine shifts in public opinion for each reason for seeking abortion. Several interesting trends emerge. First, abortion when the mother’s health is at risk has consistently received overwhelming support since 1972, maintaining around 80% support throughout this period. This is the only category that shows no significant changes in support over time. For all other reasons, however, support has fluctuated: a decline in support occurred between 1985 and 1987, followed by an increase between 1990 and 1995, a decline between 1995 and 2005, a noticeable increase in 2010, and then a steady rise thereafter.\nAs seen in the previous graph, the trend holds true, with overwhelming support for abortion when the mother’s health is at risk, followed by strong support for abortion in cases of rape and serious birth defects. The remaining reasons receive much lower levels of support, in the following order: financial hardship, the mother is married and does not want more children, the mother is single and does not want to marry the father, and finally, the lowest support is for abortion for any reason.\nAdditionally, we observe that support for abortion for any reason is consistently lower than support for other reasons until 1995, when it occasionally surpasses support for other categories in certain years.\nNotice that some of the trends observed in our data correspond to historical events in the U.S. that might have affected the public opinion on the question of abortion. For example, 1973 marks the year when the Roe v Wade decision was made by the US Supreme Court, legalizing abortion in the United States. As such, earlier support for abortion in the early 70s might have been fueled by this landmark decision. The rise of the religious right in the early 1980s as well as the passing of restrictive laws such as the Abortion Control Act of 1982 might have caused a decline in the public’s support of abortion. The early 1990s marked a surge of violence against clinics and providers as well as the The Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992, which protected Roe but allowed for state restrictions against abortion. Following 2010, activism relating to reproductive rights increased with movements like “#Me Too” and the passing of more restrictive laws in states such as Texas and North Dakota. Under Trump’s presidency, the anti-abortion movement continued to rise with more states attempting to pass more restrictive laws, however, this movement was faced by a rising push back although eventually the Dobbs case ultimately overturning Roe v Wade in 2022. Source\n\n\n3.1.3 How does the public opinion on abortion vary for different demographic groups across time? How does it vary for each of the reasons for seeking abortion? Which demographic show the most similarities amongst its groups and which shows the most differences?\nIn this report, we focus on presenting graphs that highlight the most significant similarities and differences in responses regarding the legality of abortion across demographics. While we explored all the demographic categories outlined in the Data Cleaning section, we found that some groups in particular exhibited notable differences in opinion. However, upon further investigation, we found out that the results for some demographics might be misleading due to the small representation of certain groups in the survey. For example, when examining religious affiliations of respondents, we found that 82.68% of respondents identified as Christian, while only 2.08% were Jewish, 0.19% Muslim, and 0.15% Hindu. Between 1977 and 2022, only 15 Native Americans and 63 Hindus were surveyed. As such, we are unable to make meaningful comparisons within these religious groups as the sample size of certain groups in the survey is very small and therefore analysis of any trends can be misleading. A similar issue arose when analyzing responses based on the highest degree achieved and race. For example, we found that 81.16% of respondents are white, which means that the sample of respondents lacks in racial diversity. Additionally, note that the racial categories considered in the survey were limited to “White,” “Black,” and “Other,” which further constrains the analysis.\nWith this being said, we found that different groups within the age and sex demographics do show similar trends across time in their support of abortion based on the different abortion reasons. These groups are also equally represented in the survey, which makes the analysis valid. Note that for the age demographic, each 5 year group represents 8-11% of the respondents, therefore the different age groups are equally represented. Then, for the sex demographic, around 44% are male and 55% are female. We present below the graph showing the percentage of each sex group in favor of abortion by abortion reason across time - the groups in this demographic show the most similarity in their trend of abortion support.\n\n\nCode\nprc_dem_sex_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\", \"rape\",\"birth defect\", \"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\"))) |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, sex, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\nggplot(prc_dem_sex_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\", sex != is.na(sex)), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.3,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(size = 0.8) +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Change in Percentage of Repondents In Favor of Abortion by Demographic (Sex) Group \\n Across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(23) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous() +\n  facet_wrap(~sex, ncol = 1) + #scale_fill_brewer(name = \"Response\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 27)) \n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the two groups show similar patterns of abortion support over time across different reasons, which is somewhat unexpected, as one might assume that women, given that abortion directly affects them more than men, would show stronger support. However, between 2010 and 2015, men appear to show more support for abortion in cases where the pregnancy results from rape compared to women. Support for abortion when the mother’s health is at risk also seems to be slightly higher among men. Additionally, the “married but does not want more children” category shows slightly more support from men than women between 2005 and 2015.\nThe demographic category that shows the most divergent trends is the one based on political and social views. The results here are not surprising, as we observe a clear upward trend in abortion support over time among the most liberal respondents, with high support for all abortion reasons. In contrast, conservatives show a downward trend in support over time, with much lower support for abortion except in cases of rape, the mother’s health, or fetal abnormalities. Moderates and those who identify as slightly conservative show relatively little variation in their views on abortion across time. Although each group in this demographic is well represented in the survey, only 3% of respondents identify as extremely liberal and 3% as extremely conservative (approximately 1,220 individuals in each group). We believe this low percentage reflects societal variation, and the sample size is sufficiently robust for analysis.\n\n\nCode\nprc_dem_polviews_noNA = gss_ab_fct_noNA |&gt;\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(`mother's health`,`rape`,`birth defect`,`financial hardship`,`married-no more children`,`not married`, `any reason`), \n                   names_to = \"abortion_reason\",values_to = \"response\") |&gt;\n      mutate(abortion_reason = factor(abortion_reason, levels= c(\"mother's health\", \"rape\",\"birth defect\", \"financial hardship\",\"married-no more children\",\"not married\", \"any reason\"))) |&gt; group_by(year, abortion_reason, polviews, response) |&gt; summarize(n=n()) |&gt; mutate(prop = n/sum(n))\n\nggplot(prc_dem_polviews_noNA |&gt; filter(response == \"yes\"), aes(x=year, y=prop, color = abortion_reason)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1,color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line(size = 0.7) +\n  labs (x = \"Year\", y = \"Proportion of Positive Responses\", title = \"Change in Percentage of Repondents In Favor of Abortion by Demographic (Social/Political Belief) Group \\n Across Time (1972-2022)\", color = \"Abortion Reason\") + theme_bw(23) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous() +\n  facet_wrap(~polviews, ncol = 2) +\n  #scale_color_manual(values = my_palette) +\n  #scale_color_brewer(name = \"Response\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 27))"

Specifically, two questions were added: “What do you think the chances are these days that a white person won’t get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified black person gets one instead” (coded in the dataset as discaff), and “Are you for or against preferential hiring and promotion of blacks?” (coded in the dataset as affrmact). We will primarily focus on the latter of these variables as it more directly approaches peoples’ beliefs about social programs, but both of these are useful to investigate. These variables are coded in opposite directions: discaff is coded such that lower numbers indicate that the respondent believes affirmative action programs are likely to harm white applicants; while affrmact is coded such that lower numbers indicate more support for affirmative action.\n\n3.2.1 Does the public opinion on affirmative action vary consistently by region over time?\n\n\nCode\nyear_averages &lt;- gss_d |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(as.factor(affrmact)), !is.na(as.factor(discaff))) |&gt;\n  mutate(region_recode = fct_recode(haven::as_factor(region), \n                            \"midwest\" = \"west north central\",\n                            \"midwest\" = \"east north central\",\n                            \"northeast\" = \"new england\",\n                            \"northeast\" = \"middle atlantic\",\n                            \"south\" = \"west south central\",\n                            \"south\" = \"east south atlantic\",\n                            \"south\" = \"south atlantic\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, region_recode) |&gt;\n  summarize(affrmact_avg = mean(affrmact), discaff_avg = mean(discaff))\n\nb &lt;- ggplot(year_averages, aes(x = year, y = affrmact_avg, color = region_recode)) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.9, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_line() + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Region\") +\n  theme_bw(12) + \n  labs(y = \"Average Support to Opposition on a 1-4 scale\", x = \"Year\") +\n  #scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\", name = \"Region\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Regional Opinions on Affirmative Action Over Time\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14)) \nb\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first examine whether there is consistent regional variation for support (lower-number responses on this scale) or opposition (higher-number responses on this scale) over the period of time that affirmative action has been on the GSS. Interestingly, the only pattern that really stands out is that the northeast has been generally more likely to support affirmative action over the time where the question was asked, while other regions have oscillated in their relative positions over time. This is perhaps indicative that political divisions on this issue are less regionally varied than the standard political assumptions that political analysts tend to make.\n\n\n3.2.2 Do views on affirmative action vary with political views?\n\n\nCode\nyear_averages_pol &lt;- gss_d |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(as.factor(affrmact)), !is.na(as.factor(discaff)), !is.na(as.factor(polviews))) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, polviews) |&gt;\n  summarize(affrmact_avg = mean(affrmact), discaff_avg = mean(discaff))\n\nc &lt;- ggplot(year_averages_pol, aes(x = affrmact_avg, y = discaff_avg, color= fct_recode(haven::as_factor(polviews), \"moderate\" = \"moderate, middle of the road\"))) + \n  geom_point(size = 3) + \n  labs(x = \"Average Support to Opposition for Affirmative Action on a 1-4 scale\",\n       y = \"Average Belief that Affirmative Action Does Not Harm White People on a 1-3 scale\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Correlating views on Affirmative Action, by Political Leaning\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"BrBG\", name = \"Political Views\") + \n  theme_bw(12) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16)) \nc\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can see a clear correlation between support for affirmative action and the belief that it does not harm white people when implemented, as one might expect. Each point is a single year’s sample, split between the options for self-described political views provided by the GSS, taking the average of responses to those variables. Interestingly, it is not a particularly tight correlation, with a fairly wide spread in the relationship between the two variables, although there is evident clustering on the political view scale, with people who have similar political views having fairly similar views on affirmative action. However, that clustering has a lot of overlap, and could not be derived without knowing the respondents’ self-identified political views. In fact, we can see overlap of groups as disparate as “moderate” and “extremely conservative”, though we do not see as much overlap between groups on the liberal side of the spectrum.\n\n\n3.2.3 Variation in opinions across generations\n\n\nCode\n year_averages_by &lt;- gss_d |&gt;\n   filter(!is.na(as.factor(affrmact)), !is.na(as.factor(age))) |&gt;\n   mutate(birthyear = year - age)\n\nd &lt;- ggplot(year_averages_by, aes(x=birthyear, fill=haven::as_factor(affrmact))) +\n  geom_bar(position=\"fill\") + \n  theme_bw(12) + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"BrBG\", name = \"Opinion on Affirmative Action\") + \n  labs(y = \"Proportion of Population\", x = \"Birth Year\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Opinions on Affirmative Action by Birth Year\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14)) \nd\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this chart, we calculate the approximate birth year of respondents based on their age at the time of the survey. We can see that as people get younger, they are significantly more likely to favor affirmative action, though no group ever reached a majority in favor until very recently - and either tail end should be taken as likely very distorted due to a smaller sample size. The main feature evident here is that over time, the proportion of respondents answering “strongly favors” is mainly what has increased, with the “strongly opposes” decreasing, while the less-extreme views essentially stay consistent in their proportions.\n\n\n3.2.4 Do opinions on affirmative action vary with employment status?\n\n\nCode\na &lt;- gss_d |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(as.factor(affrmact)), !is.na(as.factor(wrkstat))) |&gt;\n  mutate(worknew = fct_recode(haven::as_factor(wrkstat),\n                          \"employed\" = \"with a job, but not at work because of temporary illness, vacation, strike\",\n                          \"employed\" = \"working part time\",\n                          \"employed\" = \"working full time\",\n                          \"stay-at-home\" = \"keeping house\",\n                          \"unemployed\" = \"unemployed, laid off, looking for work\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(affrmact, worknew, year) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  group_by(worknew, year) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = count/sum(count)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=year, color = haven::as_factor(affrmact), y = prop)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9, color = 'black') + \n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~worknew, ncol=1) + \n  scale_color_brewer(name = \"Opinion on Affirmative Action\", palette = \"BrBG\") + \n  labs(y = \"Proportion of Respondents\", x = \"Year\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Variation of Viewpoints on Affirmative Action over Time, by Employment Status\") + \n  theme_bw(12)+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14)) \na\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical scientists often hypothesize that economic circumstances are correlated with beliefs about racial resentment, so we will break the responses over time down by employment status. As with other trends, we do see decreasing opposition to affirmative action for most groups, though the steepest decrease occurs with respondents currently in school. Interestingly, the unemployed also have a fairly large change over time, moreso than the currently-employed, while retired people and people who choose not to be employed in order to stay at home show less distinct changes in their opinions, but still broadly follow the same trends. However, generally, we see that both the unemployed and employed have similar feelings about affirmative action as each other over time"

    "text": "3.3 Capital Punishment\n\n3.3.1 Declining support for capital punishment over the past 50 years\nThe decline in support for capital punishment beginning in the 1990s is likely attributed to multiple factors. Some of these include growing awareness of wrongful convictions highlighted by DNA exoneration, concerns about racial disparities in sentencing, and shifting moral perspectives on state-sanctioned executions. Additionally, declining crime rates in the late 1990s and 2000s may have reduced public demand for harsh punishments. The emergence of life without parole as an alternative sentence and increased focus on the high costs of death penalty cases also likely contributed to this trend. While no single factor can be pinpointed as the sole cause, this combination of legal, social, and economic considerations has likely shaped public opinion over time.\n\n\nCode\ncappun_data &lt;- gss_all |&gt; \n  select(year, cappun) |&gt; \n  filter(cappun == 1 | cappun == 2) |&gt;\n  mutate(cappun = factor(cappun, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Favor\", \n                                                              \"Oppose\")))\n\ncappun_summary &lt;- cappun_data |&gt;\n  group_by(year, cappun) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) |&gt; \n  filter(cappun == \"Favor\")\n\nggplot(cappun_summary, aes(x = year, \n                           y = proportion)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.2, position = \"identity\", fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_line(color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"America's Changing View on Capital Punishment\",\n    subtitle = \"Public Opinion Trends (1974-2018)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Respondents in Favor of Capital Punishment\",\n    caption = \"Source: General Social Survey\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray40\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray40\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1985, \n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"#BF812D\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1985, y = 0.60, \n           label = \"Peak\\n(80% Favor)\", \n           color = \"#BF812D\", \n           fontface = \"italic\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2000,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"#01665E\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2000, y = 0.50, \n           label = \"DNA exonerations\\ngain attention\", \n           color = \"#01665E\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, \n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"#01665E\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2007, y = 0.20, \n           label = \"New Jersey\\nabolishes death penalty\", \n           color = \"#01665E\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2021, \n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"#BF812D\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2019, y = 0.50, \n           label = \"Low \\n(56% Favor)\", \n           color = \"#BF812D\",\n           fontface = \"italic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 How does support for capital punishment vary by race and religion?\n\n3.3.2.1 Race\nThe racial disparity in support for capital punishment, with Black people opposing it more than White people, reflects complex historical and societal factors. This difference likely stems from the Black community’s experiences with systemic racism in the criminal justice system, including higher rates of wrongful convictions and disproportionate application of the death penalty. Black Americans may view capital punishment as an extension of historical injustices, from slavery to lynchings, leading to a deeper skepticism of the state’s power over life and death. Conversely, White Americans, generally experiencing more favorable treatment in the justice system, may be more likely to trust its processes and view capital punishment as a legitimate form of justice. This racial divide underscores how personal and communal experiences with law enforcement and the broader criminal justice system can profoundly shape perspectives on punitive measures like the death penalty.\n\n\nCode\ncappun_data &lt;- gss_all |&gt; \n  select(year, race, cappun) |&gt;\n  filter((cappun==1 | cappun==2), race %in% c(1,2))\n\ncappun_data$cappun &lt;- factor(cappun_data$cappun, \n                             levels = c(\"1\", \"2\"),\n                             labels = c(\"Favor\", \"Oppose\"))\n\nggplot(cappun_data, aes(x = as.factor(year), fill = cappun)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ race, scales = \"free_x\", \n             labeller = labeller(race = c(\"1\" = \"White\", \n                                          \"2\" = \"Black\", \n                                          \"3\" = \"Other\"))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Capital Punishment Opinions by Race over Time\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Proportion of Respondents\",\n    fill = \"Opinion\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 4)]) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Favor\" = \"#DFC27D\", \"Oppose\" = \"#80CDC1\")) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  ) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Religion\nReligious views on capital punishment often reflect beliefs about the afterlife and moral justice. Protestant and Catholic traditions, showing higher support, may emphasize divine judgment and the concept of earthly consequences for actions. Eastern religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, with lower support, tend to view life as cyclical and interconnected, focusing on karma and reincarnation rather than final judgment. This perspective may lead to a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and the sanctity of all life. The varying levels of support across religions highlight how different conceptions of the soul, divine justice, and the nature of existence can significantly influence attitudes towards punitive measures in this life.\n\n\nCode\ncappun_data &lt;- gss_all |&gt;\n  select(year, sex, relig, degree, cappun) |&gt;\n  filter(cappun %in% c(1, 2)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    cappun = factor(cappun, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Favor\", \"Oppose\")),\n    sex = factor(sex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")),\n    relig = factor(relig, levels = c(1,2,3,4,6,7,9,11), labels = c(\n      \"protestant\", \"catholic\", \"jewish\", \"none\", \n      \"buddhism\", \"hinduism\", \"islam\", \"christian\"))\n  )\n\nrelig_summary &lt;- cappun_data |&gt;\n  group_by(relig, cappun) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(relig) |&gt;\n  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) |&gt;\n  filter(cappun == \"Favor\", !is.na(relig))\n\ncorrect_order &lt;- c(\"protestant\", \"catholic\", \"jewish\", \"christian\", \n                   \"none\", \"hinduism\", \"islam\", \"buddhism\")\nrelig_summary &lt;- relig_summary |&gt;\n  mutate(relig = factor(relig, levels = correct_order))\n\nggplot(relig_summary, aes(x = relig, y = proportion)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#DFC27D\", width = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(proportion, accuracy = 0.1)), \n            vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Support for Capital Punishment by Religion\",\n       x = \"Religion\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Respondents Favoring\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14))"

    "text": "Over time, across these three controversial issues, we see the general public liberalizing on these topics. Although starting positions on the issues are quite conservative compared to today, throughout demographics and regions, on a trend over time, opinions have broadly shifted in favor of more abortion rights, increased tolerance for affirmative action, and against capital punishment. There are a couple notable exceptions: those identifying as conservative and extremely conservative have shifted against abortion rights in the last fifty years, and Black americans have retained fairly consistent opposition to capital punishment over time. These trends indicate an underlying dynamic to the way that public opinions change over time. Although changes often occur across identities, social groups and subcultures often move as a whole, in ways that both align with and diverge from the broader changes in social grouping.\nThe timing of the broader societal shifts is particularly interesting. Support for abortion, while steady in the general population prior to 1995, actually decreased between then and 2005, bounced back until 2010, and began increasing sharply after 2016. It is not a surprise that the major shfits in public opinion align with national elections where abortion rights were a major issue, and the last large uptick in support occurred under an administration opposed to abortion rights. Interestingly, the ongoing conservative opposition to abortion seems to be a fairly steady trend unrelated to contemporary political developments.\nMeanwhile, trends in beliefs about affirmative action seem to be essentially continuous trends across time, aside from a notable jump in support specifically among students in 2010. It’s not entirely clear what this jump in support is the result of - there was one notable Supreme Court Case (2009), but it does not have to do with students, and while a notable case, did not reach the kind of media saturation that enormous cases like Obergefell v. Hodges did.\nFinally, opinions on the death penalty do seem to be influenced by news events. After a peak of support in 1985, we can see that DNA exoneration and the abolition of the death penalty in several states are associated with a change in the rate growing disfavor for the death penalty. Therefore, we can also understand these issues as being self-reinforcing: not only do the political opinions of individuals inform how governing rules are set up; but the rules and governments that are in place influence the opinions people hold.",
