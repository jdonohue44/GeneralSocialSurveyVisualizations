# Introduction

We choose to explore opinions on affirmative action and abortion as two highly debated and significant social issues in the United States, with strong political, cultural, and moral implications. Understanding how people's views on these issues have evolved over time and how they vary across different demographic groups—such as gender, age, political affiliation, and other factors—can offer valuable insights into societal changes and help explain current political and social divisions. The demographic variables of interest in this analysis include gender, age, geographic location, political affiliation, race, year, education level, income, religious affiliation, and marital status/relationship. By using data from the General Social Survey (GSS), we will investigate how different groups’ opinions have shifted over time and explore any correlations between these views and the demographic factors. This analysis will provide a clearer picture of the broader trends in public opinion and the factors that influence these complex issues.
